#write math statements that results in 8.
print(5+3)
print(2*4)
print(15-7)
print(24/3)

#store a number in a variable, then print it.
number = 52
print("Sarah is " + str(number) + " years old.")

#we need the str() because numbers can be represtend and both string or integer
#str() lets python know that you want the variable represent as a string
#similarly, you have to use int() if you want an integer
