Vectors

Vectors are characters, numbers, and booleans

a <- c(1,2,5.3,6,-2,4) # numeric vector
b <- c("one","two","three") # character vector
c <- c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE) #logical vector

Vectors can only contain values of the same type, not mixing and matching

d <- c(1,2,TRUE,"one") CANNOT work




Matrices 

A matrix is a collection of data elements arranged in a two-dimensional rectangular layout. The following is an example of a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns.

             
A =   [2  4  3
       1  5  7]

This is how to create a matrix. The data elements must be of the same basic type.
 
A = matrix( 
+   c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7), # the data elements 
+   nrow=2,              # number of rows 
+   ncol=3,              # number of columns 
+   byrow = TRUE)        # fill matrix by rows (makes inputs c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7)                                  horralzontally)

This will result in the matrix A shown above. We can replace the vectors with a different type (eg: TRUE or "Hello"), but the entire data of the matrix has to be the same type.





Arrays

Arrays are the R data objects which can store data in more than two dimensions. For example âˆ’ If we create an array of dimension (2, 3, 4) then it creates 4 rectangular matrices each with 2 rows and 3 columns. Arrays can store only data type.

(not sure what this means? creates mutliple matricies?)



Data Frames
These are like matricies but the data types can be different values



Lists
contains a list of data which can be different data types
list_data <- list("Red", "Green", c(21,32,11), TRUE, 51.23, 119.1)
